# CSC Generation Take Home Challenge   
   
The code portion has 2 solutions provided, one is a simple Javascript implementation and one is an implementation using the library lodash. To have the option to run the test code with the lodash implementation, please run the following command before using the exported functions:

``` npm install```

## Basic Usage

The module exports two functions:   
   
`sortCategoriesForInsertWithLibraries` which uses the library lodash for sorting,
`sortCategoriesForInsert` which is just regular javascript and has no dependencies.

All code is written and managed in the index.js file.
